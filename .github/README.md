# MacOS dot files

This is my actual dotfiles that I use all day long for all kind of stuff, for working and for personal projects. I've decided to make everything install manually because I don't like to use another software to install my default configuration. All of this configuration is main focused on macOS, but could be adapted for another uses, like linux (but I think nothing of this will makes sense on Windows, sorry). Feel free to explore all my configuration and get what you feel makes sense to you! :^)
